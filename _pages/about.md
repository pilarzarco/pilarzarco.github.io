## ‚ú® About me 
Hi! I'm Pilar, a Machine Learning and statistics enthusiast. I am a final year MPhys Astrophysics student at [The University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/). I'm passionate about tackling complex problems through predictive AI and Machine Learning. In particular, I like Gaussian Processes, Bayesian Optimization and Inference models. 

I'm currently finishing my final year (MPhys) project under the supervision of Dr Benjamin Giblin and Prof Alkistis Pourtsidou on "How to predict accurate cosmological statistics in any model of gravity". 
Our goal is to select the most optimal parameters to run cosmological simulations efficiently.
